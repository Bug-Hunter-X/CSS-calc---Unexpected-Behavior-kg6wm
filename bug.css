The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can lead to unexpected results if not used carefully. For example, if you use `calc()` to calculate the width of an element, and the result is a floating-point number (e.g., 10.5px), the browser may round the value to the nearest integer, leading to unexpected layout issues. Similarly, if you use `calc()` in combination with other CSS properties, the order of operations might not be what you expect.
